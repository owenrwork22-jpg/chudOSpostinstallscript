ChudOS v3 is a customized Ubuntu-based operating system built for users who want a fast, lightweight, and unapologetically chud-coded Linux experience. The goal of ChudOS is simple: remove the unnecessary, add the useful, and ship an OS that feels unique, nostalgic, and efficient right out of the box.

## 📜 Backstory

ChudOS was created by a chud living a chud life who simply wanted a chud operating system for the world. Tired of corporate polish and bloated installs, they built an OS that reflects their own style: simple, fast, retro, loud, and proudly unfiltered.

ChudOS exists because sometimes the world just needs an operating system with **personality**.
